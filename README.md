# XXX Interview Coding Test - Instructions

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k8mexsj23a615pkt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/xxx-interview-instructions)

Built with .NET 5.0.

What is this?

This is the solution to an interview coding test I wrote for a contract I never applied for - a friend & I were talking about it and I thought I'd give it ago!

Included below is the spec followed by my results, but the major thing to note is I built this in .Net 5.0 not .Net 4.6.1 or less - so i guess I failed already :)
